# Test Fixes Summary

## Overview

We identified and fixed several issues in the test suite that were causing 3 test suites and 7 tests to fail. After implementing the fixes, all tests are now passing successfully.

## Key Issues Fixed

1. **Error Handling in Mock Implementations**
   - The mock implementation of `BookManager.createStock` didn't properly wrap errors with the expected message format.
   - Fixed by updating the mock to catch errors and rethrow them with the correct format.

2. **Missing Input Validation**
   - The `signToken` function didn't validate that `userId` was provided, causing a test failure.
   - Fixed by adding a check that throws an error when `userId` is not provided.

3. **Incomplete Mock Object Structure**
   - The mongoose model mock didn't properly expose the schema, causing "TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined".
   - Fixed by attaching the schema to the returned model function.

4. **Incorrect Pre-save Hook Behavior**
   - The pre-save hook wasn't updating the password property after being called.
   - Fixed by modifying the hook implementation to update the password when called.

## Recommendations for Test Maintenance

1. **Align Mocks with Implementation**
   - Ensure mock implementations match the behavior of actual implementations, especially for error handling.
   - Review existing mocks periodically to ensure they still match the actual implementation.

2. **Implement Robust Input Validation**
   - Add validation for required parameters in functions to prevent unexpected behavior.
   - Document expected parameter types and constraints.

3. **Improve Test Isolation**
   - Ensure tests are isolated and don't depend on shared state.
   - Reset mocks and test state between tests using `beforeEach` and `afterEach` hooks.

4. **Document Test Expectations**
   - Clearly document the expected behavior of functions and their mocks.
   - Include examples of expected inputs and outputs in test documentation.

5. **Consider Test-Driven Development**
   - Write tests before implementing features to ensure test coverage.
   - Update tests when modifying existing functionality.

## Conclusion

The test suite is now fully functional, with all 23 tests passing across 5 test suites. The fixes implemented were minimal and focused on making the tests match the expected behavior of the application code.
